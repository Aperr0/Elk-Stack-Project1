      3. Now that you have a feel for the data, Let's dive a bit deeper. Look at the chart that shows Unique Visitors Vs. Average Bytes.

         * Locate the time frame in the last 7 days with the most amount of bytes (activity).
         * In your own words, is there anything that seems potentially strange about this activity? At 22:55 there was a very large spike in the average byte without a jump in users
         4. Filter the data by this event.
